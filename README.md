# The Globetrotter's Gazette
## Introduction

Welcome to the Globetrotter's Gazette, a place to share your travel experiences from all around the world. Read posts from all different countries, share these posts, even join in the conversation by leaving a comment! This is a community for globetrotter's alike to come together and share their love of travelling.
